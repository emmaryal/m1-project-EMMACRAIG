  <p>Cats groom themselves with constant regular licking, and this stops skin oils from building up on their fur. As a result a cat's coat is fluffier and less waterproof than a dog's, so they get colder and their fur feels heavier if they get wet.</p><span>read more</span>

<p>Kitty gives you a tongue bath because she accepts you as a member of her family and feels completely secure when she’s with you. She remembers how her mother gave her cleanings as a kitten and now is continuing what she learned, only with the roles reversed (unless you happen to lick her as well). Your cat is nurturing you in the best way she knows how – by keeping you clean and claiming you as her own.</p><span>read more</span>

<p>In the wild, cat mothers teach their young how to eat their food by bringing home dead or injured prey. ... By leaving a dead animal on the back porch, your cat is acting out its natural role as mother and teacher. You, her loving owner, represent her surrogate family.
